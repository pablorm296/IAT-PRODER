# IAT (Proyecto sobre Discriminación Étnico-Racial en México)

This is an Implicit Association Test (IAT) designed to measure the strength of stereotypes on skin tones. This test was created for the [Ethnoracial Discrimination in Mexico Research Project](https://discriminacion.colmex.mx/) at [El Colegio de México](https://www.colmex.mx/en).

## Overview :mag:

This IAT is based on the [Stereotype Content Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_content_model) (SCM), and its main objective is to measure the strength of associations between two target categories (dark-skin, white-skin) and implicit stereotypes.

The back end implementation is a python application (mainly using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)) in charge of processing user interaction and managing sessions. It exposes a [Public REST API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) as the main way of communication with the front end.

**Test design:** Stephanie Posadas Narvaéz.

**Test implementation:** Pablo Reyes Moctezuma.
