# IAT (Proyecto sobre Discriminación Étnico-Racial en México)

This is an Implicit Association Test (IAT) designed to measure the strength of stereotypes on skin tones. This test was created for the [Ethnoracial Discrimination in Mexico Research Project](https://discriminacion.colmex.mx/) at [El Colegio de México](https://www.colmex.mx/en).

## Overview :mag:

This IAT is based on the [Stereotype Content Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_content_model) (SCM), and its main objective is to measure the strength of associations between two target categories (dark skin, white skin) and implicit stereotypes.

The server side implementation uses Python (mainly [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)), to process user interaction, serve dynamic pages and manage sessions. It also uses MongoDB as the main storage service. The Python application exposes a [Public REST API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) as the main way of communication with the client side (a basic mix of plain JS, SASS, and HTML).

**Test design:** Stephanie Posadas Narvaéz.

**Test implementation:** Pablo Reyes Moctezuma.
